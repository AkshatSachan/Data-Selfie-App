# Data-Selfie-App
☘️  This project makes use of the geolocation API and captures a photo from the webcam on the client side.<br>
✨ This data is then passed on to the server where it is stored in a database.<br>
🔍 The current view of the database can also be seen from the client side at the click of a button.
